Burnside Park, 40 Kennedy Plaza, Providence, RI

> It has creative exploration areas where kids can play in the middle of the city. The playground features structures that look like the masts of a ship, complete with netting sails and rigging for climbing and ropes for tightrope-walking. There’s a giant swing that can fit several children at once, as well as regular swings, a slide and jungle gym, musical instruments like upright xylophones and a spinning wheel that’s a twist on a merry-go-round.
