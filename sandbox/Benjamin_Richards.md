## BFISH: The Bottomfish Fishery-Independent Survey in Hawaii

**Accurate** and **precise** stock assessments are predicated on accurate and precise estimates of life history parameters, abundance, and catch across the range of the stock. In its continued efforts to improve the data used in stock assessments, the NOAA Pacific islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) implemented a [Bottomfish Fishery-Independent Survey in Hawaii (BFISH)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/53762) in 2016. The BFISH survey utilizes two gear types, [Cooperative Research hook-and-line fishing operations (CRF)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/20969) and the [Modular Optical Underwater Survey System (MOUSS)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/20970). Survey sampling is conducted annually, typically in the fall, surrounding the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), in accordance with a stratified-random sampling design. Under this design, the waters surrounding the MHI are gridded at 500 meter resolution. Each grid is given attributes of depth, slope, and [seafloor hardness](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/31636).

- Depth categories
    - Shallow (75-200 meters),
    - Medium (200-300 meters),
    - Deep (300-400 meters).
- Slope categories
    - Low slope (0-10 degrees)
    - High (10-90 degrees).
- Seafloor categories
    - Hardbottom
    - Softbottom.

Annual survey data are processed to produce relative and absolute abundance and biomass estimates for the [Stock Assessment for the Main Hawaiian Islands Deep 7 Bottomfish Complex](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/stock-assessment-update-main-hawaiian-islands-deep-7-bottomfish-complex-2021).

## Artificial Intelligence

### Background
*AI is not new to NOAA*. NOAA’s robust experience with AI applications
across a range of mission areas are already demonstrating significant
improvements in performance and skill at greatly reduced costs and
compute time in arenas as diverse as deep-sea exploration, habitat
characterization, and processing of earth observations. By strengthening
coordination, operational capabilities, workforce proficiency, and
multisector partnerships, NOAA’s national and global leadership in AI
supports science, public safety, and security.
Specific AI examples include:

1. aerial and underwater surveys from ships
and autonomous platforms to assess the abundance of marine mammal
and fish populations,
2. robotics for deep-sea exploration,
3. quality
control of weather observations,
4. improving physical parameterization
for weather, ocean, ice modeling, and improving the computational
performance of numerical models,
5. aiding weather warning generation,
6. operation of unmanned systems for bathymetric mapping, habitat
characterization, hydrologic, oceanographic, atmospheric, fishery,
ecosystem, and geographic surveys,
7. supporting partners in wildfire
detection and movement, and
8. using machine learning (ML) for
reliable and efficient processing, interpretation, and utilization of earth
observations.

Despite this notable progress, the true potential for AI to
advance NOAA’s mission has not been realized because all NOAA AI activity
heretofore has originated within individual offices with no institutional
support. Additionally, some development has been redundant because
of a lack of awareness across the agency due to the absence of a
coordinating directive or authority.

### Vision
Through the [NOAA AI Strategy](https://sciencecouncil.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2020-AI-Strategy.pdf), expansion of Artificial Intelligence
is accelerated across the entire agency to make transformative
improvements in NOAA mission performance and cost effectiveness.

### Purpose
The goals and supporting objectives in this strategy are intended to
directly improve the understanding, coordination, awareness, and
application of AI across all of NOAA. By directing organizational and
process improvements to more rapidly transition research, strengthen
and expand partnerships, and deliberately develop AI proficiency
across the NOAA workforce, the guidance below will result in
transformational advances in every NOAA mission area. A fundamental
consideration is that the objectives within any goals support and are
supported by objectives under the other goals in this strategy, thus
requiring matrixed collaboration during implementation.
